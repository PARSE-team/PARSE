    - fix user-defined data bug

    - try to make XYCursor label more prominent (font size, color, or "cursor value")
- (15 min) remove label viewer in file selection window
- (15 min) improve the text labels overlapping
    - only keep selected range, set default smaller than the window
    - if you have time, make it right
- (30 min) use icons for play/pause
- (15 min) adjust min/max for parameters
    - 0% --> (minimum sample size) (next to percent window per hop)
- (120 min) improve timestamps
    - avoid astropy altogether? (check if it works correctly on installer first)
    - change "sec in file" --> to "sec in day" (GRAPH OVERVIEW)
    - change sec in file to global time
        - change widget to a datetime
        - set min and max datetimes
        - read user's datetime into astropy
        - use instead of start_sec_user
    - date in top right isn't updating correctly (change to be changed when start_sec isn't 0)
    - change overview times to have no decimals
- (30 min) record Youtube video


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: SoftwareX Release
- Review Liz's Changes:
    - set min/max values
    - ERROR bandwidth (google doc)
    - ERROR direct signal
        - use the same location function for freq center and overview plot
    - if there is an error, update the signal analysis tab accordingly
        - just direct signal: globals work, locals show the same
        - no signal: dashes?
    - other errors?
- clean up animation function(s)
- (30 min) truncate Rosetta file and label
    - check which values mkelley reads from label file, then edit them
- does the program read the name of the Dawn file to find metadata, like the band name?
- if Apply Changes already uses a worker thread, then add a progress bar, but don't waste time on it!
- combine rows in file selection window (or highlight both)
- make all text interactive
- BUG: is the signal window reinitialized after back arrow, or just hidden (old settings?)
- add a menu bar, even if it's empty
- make PARSE logo higher-resolution
- make red line thicker
- add export video button (use ffmpeg to export video)
- fix windows icon
- BUG: double check potential mistake (near get_psd in signal_processing.py)
    - fix the argmax (np vs python)
    - check if the brackets are causing an issue
- rename functions and classes
- clean code
    - update file descriptions
    - improve comments and docstrings
    - remove print statements
    - remove tasks
    - line length
- generally compare code to example repos
- check the example GitHub's to see how to remove dependencies
- WHAT ARE AND HOW TO WRITE UNIT TESTS?
    - unit tests should throw interface errors
    - test if the PDS data is being read correctly
    - tests for if the user-defined dataset is formatted correctly
- remake environment and generate installers
- Documentation
    - README
        - (later) mention fbs run
        - (later) setup instructions for environment (see examples)
        - (later) warning about download, install, open, and processing times
        - (later) add screenshots
        - (later) resize images
    - (later) in the paper and manual, explain multithreading and workers
    - (later) explain resource bundling and ApplicationContext
    - (later) mention mkelley
    - (later) hooks
- ask Liz to mention that the Rosetta data has been altered


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: (Email) SoftwareX Pre-Release
- a bug that caused the overview plot to misidentify the direct signal has been fixed. This changed the overview plot in the Dawn dataset, as I discussed with Liz on Saturday.
- all menu buttons on the start window are fully working, including the video tutorial
- the "Apply Changes" button is now much faster (does not re-compute the overview plot)
- the window properties and animation playback parameters have been separated from the signal processing pipeline, and are more clearly separated from the rest of the parameters in the interface
- the overview plot now displays both RCP and LCP
- the "Export as ASCII" button has now been implemented
- the "User-Defined Data" option has now been implemented
- a bug that caused text labels on the results plot to overlap will be patched, either by removing the text or by manually programming the text to format correctly (time permitting)
- use more prominent icons for the play/pause buttons
- set the min/max values for all parameters, as described by Liz
- all instances of dates/times have been reformatted, as described by Liz

TODO: (Email) TODO: SoftwareX Release
- include Liz's corrections regarding bandwidth and peak detection, as these affect performance and I need to review them more carefully
- manually truncate the Rosetta data files to exclude the occultation
- implement the "export as video" button
- fix the Windows10 icon
- increase the resolution of the PARSE logo
- update the ReadMe file

TODO: Later
- make sure this is thread safe...
    - https://www.learnpyqt.com/courses/concurrent-execution/multithreading-pyqt-applications-qthreadpool/
    In these cases it is often better to investigate using a pure-Python thread pool
    (e.g. concurrent futures) to keep your processing and thread-event handling further isolated
    from your GUI. However, note that any Python GUI code can block other Python code unless it's
    in a separate process.
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36665850/matplotlib-animation-inside-your-own-gui
- check for memory leaks
- manually implement mkelley functions
- show frames buffered
- fix window initialization: https://www.learnpyqt.com/tutorials/creating-multiple-windows/
pyrcc5 -o resources.py resources.qrc
    - command for freezing a native PyQt5 resource file
    - this program uses a different implementation (see FBS ApplicationContext)
